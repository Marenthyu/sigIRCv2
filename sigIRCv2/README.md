You will need to download the commons-io library from the Apache Commons Library website. Download page found here: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/

You will also need the Java Twitch API Wrapper library if you are planning to use the Twitch module functionality. Download page found here: https://github.com/urgrue/Java-Twitch-Api-Wrapper/releases/tag/0.3

Include both as an External Jar and you should be good to go.
